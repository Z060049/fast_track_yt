## 1. What am I doing?
- I'm updating the UI to match a reference product â€” something that looks clean and professional.
- Focus area: Home page.

## 2. What is the reference product?
- A screenshot of a well-designed app has been uploaded.
- Use it as the visual reference for styling and layout.

## 3. What exactly needs to be changed?

### Progress Bar
- Make it **larger** and **thicker**.
- Move it **down to near the center** of the screen (as shown in the screenshot).
- Inside the progress bar:
  - Show `16 hours`
  - Below that, display `"Edit goal"`

### Calendar
- Match the **exact layout and style** in the reference image.
- Include **small circles below each date** as shown.

### Colors
- Apply a more **refined and premium color scheme**.
- Match the **red color** in the reference app to create a consistent, polished look.
